# Suicides-In-India---Beginner-Project
This is a beginner project using Python to delve into data visualization. 

ABOUT:
Mental health in India is a serious issue amongst different. From different regions, age groups, and genders, the issue of mental health has affected people of different 
backgrounds. I've decided to visualize data sourced from Kaggle in order to bring light to this serious issue and understand it's fatal effects. 

BUILT WITH:
- [Kaggle Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/suicides-in-india)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

GETTING STARTED:
I used Kaggle's online Notebook to program my data. Kaggle offers packages which makes it convenient to code and work with data. After inserting import statements, I searched
through online resources to learn how to plot data. 

USAGE/CONCLUSION:
This project can help visualize the serious impacts of mental health. Lives were taken by suicide the highest in Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. Age groups
from 15-29 and 30-44 were taken by suicide more than any age group from 0-60+. Males lives were taken by suicide more than females.
